# CTFWriteupGenerator 🗃️

## Description 🖼️

**CTFWriteupGenerator** is a repository that now includes a Python 3 script called `generate_writeup.py` that can be used to **generate write-up templates for CTF challenges**. The generated file is saved in the `writeups` folder (which can be thought of as a personal write-ups vault) and comes pre-populated with the given details and "*Lorem ipsum*" texts where manual editing is required (for example, in the description of the solution).

> ***Note***: Until recently, this repository only contained a plain Markdown file marketed as a template. This file, which would be used, was copied and filled out with the necessary information. I thought it would be worth an update because the process of completing details was slow and could be automated. The old advices found in this `README.md` file were relocated to a new one, `ADVICES.md`.
