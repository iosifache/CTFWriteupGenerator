1. Read the *P=NP* team's article ["How to Write a Good Write-up"](http://pequalsnp-team.github.io/cheatsheet/writing-good-writeup).
Some critical factors to consider are:
- Don't be too greedy or verbose when writing your content.
- As a TL;DR, you can include an abstract or summary at the top.
- Use **bold** and *italic* to emphasize the main point of the content.
- You include a few screenshots.
- The small code snippet, paths, and strings must be properly formatted.
- Your write-up must be reproducible.
- If the write-up is multilingual, English takes precedence.
